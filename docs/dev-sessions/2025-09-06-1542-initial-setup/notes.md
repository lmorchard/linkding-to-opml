5. **Debugging Poor Performance**: Needed detailed failure analysis
   - **Resolution**: Added debug mode to save failed HTML content and enhanced logging
   - **Outcome**: Discovered compressed content issue and validated common paths effectiveness

## Decisions Made

1. **Concurrent Processing**: Used worker pool pattern with configurable concurrency (default 16)
2. **Caching Strategy**: Binary gob format for simplicity and performance
3. **Tag Filtering**: Implemented AND logic for multiple tags as specified
4. **Error Handling**: Continue processing on individual failures, fail fast on API errors
5. **Feed Selection**: Take first feed found per URL (can be enhanced later)
6. **OPML Structure**: Flat list format as specified
7. **Common Feed Paths**: Added fallback logic to try standard paths (/feed, /rss, etc.) when autodiscovery fails
   - **Effectiveness**: Found 53 additional feeds out of 302 total (17.5% improvement)
   - **Decision**: Kept this enhancement as it significantly improves discovery success rate

## Technical Architecture

The final application consists of these key components:

- **CLI Layer**: Cobra-based command structure with comprehensive help
- **Configuration**: Viper-based config management supporting YAML files and CLI overrides  
- **Linkding Integration**: API client wrapper with bookmark fetching and tag filtering
- **Feed Discovery**: HTTP client + HTML parsing + RSS/Atom feed extraction
- **Caching**: Persistent gob-based cache with configurable max-age
- **Processing**: Concurrent worker pool for feed discovery
- **OPML Generation**: Standards-compliant OPML 2.0 output
- **Statistics**: Comprehensive tracking and user-friendly reporting

## Next Steps

The application is complete and ready for use. Potential future enhancements:

1. **Multiple Feed Support**: Handle sites with multiple feeds per URL
2. **Cache Management Commands**: Add subcommands for cache inspection/clearing
3. **Feed Validation**: More robust feed content validation
4. **Export Formats**: Support additional export formats beyond OPML
5. **Resume Capability**: Handle interrupted processing gracefully

## Session Summary

Successfully implemented a complete linkding-to-opml CLI tool from specification through final documentation and performance optimization.
