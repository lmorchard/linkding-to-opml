# Dev Session Notes: OPML to Linkding

## Session Start
Date: 2025-09-09
Time: 09:21
Branch: opml-to-linkding

## Progress Notes

### Import Command Design Decisions
- Duplicate handling: CLI/config option to update or skip (default: skip)
- Data to import: URL, title, description (from OPML → feed → HTML page, in that priority)
- Tagging: CLI/config option to add custom tags for the entire import run
- Missing HTML pages: Log as INFO and create bookmark with feed URL
- Import strategy: Progressive (import as we go), with detailed logging
- Dry run mode: Available as CLI option to preview without creating bookmarks
- Rate limiting: No delays, no retries, configurable concurrency (default: 16)
- Summary stats: Display at end (imported, skipped, failed counts)
- Log levels: --verbose for INFO, --debug for DEBUG, default shows errors + stats
- OPML structure: Traverse nested folders but flatten to single list (ignore hierarchy)
- Filtering: None for now (import all entries)
- Authentication: Same as export (API token and URL from config/env)

### Implementation Progress

#### Phase 1: Foundation - Basic Command Structure ✅
- Created `cmd/import.go` with basic command structure
- Added CLI arguments: --dry-run, --duplicates, --tags, --concurrency
- Integrated with viper configuration system
- Added validation for duplicates flag (skip/update)
- Command skeleton tested and working

#### Phase 2: OPML Processing ✅
- Enhanced `internal/opml/opml.go` with reading capabilities
- Added support for nested outline structures with Children field
- Implemented `ReadFile()` function to parse OPML files
- Created `GetAllFeeds()` method with recursive traversal
- Added `FeedEntry` struct for import data
- Created `internal/importer/types.go` with ImportItem and ImportStats
- Successfully tested with sample OPML file (3 feeds extracted correctly)

#### Phase 3: URL Discovery ✅
- Created `internal/feeds/fetcher.go` with enhanced RSS/Atom parsing
- Implemented Feed, RSSFeed, and AtomFeed structs with website links
- Added `FetchFeed()` function to retrieve and parse feeds
- Created `internal/importer/discovery.go` with three-tier discovery logic
- Implemented DiscoverBookmarkURL with htmlUrl → feed → fallback strategy
- Successfully tested URL discovery (Tier 1: direct htmlUrl, Tier 2: feed parsing)

#### Phase 4: Linkding Integration ✅
- Enhanced `internal/linkding/client.go` with bookmark creation/update methods
- Added CreateBookmark(), GetBookmarkByURL(), and UpdateBookmark() methods
- Updated Bookmark struct to include ID field for updates
- Created `internal/importer/processor.go` with duplicate handling logic
- Implemented ProcessBookmark with skip/update duplicate strategies
- Added ProcessOptions for configuring tags, duplicate action, and dry-run mode
- Successfully tested full processing flow (2/2 feeds processed correctly)

#### Phase 5: Concurrency & Performance ✅
- Enhanced `internal/importer/processor.go` with worker pool implementation
- Added ProcessItems() function with configurable concurrency
- Implemented thread-safe processing with sync.WaitGroup and channels
- Added WasUpdated field to ImportItem to distinguish updates from imports
- Enhanced ProcessBookmark to handle nil clients for dry-run testing
- Successfully tested concurrent processing (4 items, 2-8 workers, ~50-70ms)
